  "description": "Molly (or Little Molly, er, lilmolly on npm) is a bash script and npm module that helps you clean up unused Svelte components in your project, giving your codebase a breath of fresh air and enhancing its tidiness. (Yes, I know the Svelte compiler treeshakes so unused components aren’t bundled, but here we are talking about cognitive tidiness for a better DX.) Molly identifies and, if you like, removes Svelte components that are not imported in your project. And if, after running Molly, you need to restore components you accidentally removed, just run Molly’s undo bash script, et voilà, removed files are back where they belong.",
